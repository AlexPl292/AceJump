# AceJump

[AceJump](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7086) is a plugin for the [IntelliJ Platform](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/) that lets you jump to any symbol in the editor with just a few keystrokes.

Hitting the keyboard shortcut for AceJump (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> by default) will activate a tooltip overlay. Press any of the illustrated key combinations in sequence, and the cursor will immediately jump to that location in the editor.

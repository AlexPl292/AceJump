# AceJump

[AceJump](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7086) is a plugin for the [IntelliJ Platform](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/) that lets you jump to any symbol in the editor with just a few keystrokes. Press the keyboard shortcut for AceJump (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> by default) to activate a tooltip overlay. Type any visible string in the editor, followed by one of illustrated tags, to jump its position:

Press the AceJump shortcut a second time before completing a tag to activate *Target Mode*. Once *Target Mode* is activated, jumping to a tag will select an entire word. You can also enter *Target Mode* directly by pressing the shortcut assigned to `AceTargetMode` (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> by default).

Press the AceJump shortcut for line mode (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> by default), to target the beginning, first non-whitespace characters, and end of every visible line in the editor). Then jump to one by completing the tag.

Press the AceJump shortcut, followed by <kbd>‚Üí</kbd>, <kbd>‚Üê</kbd>, <kbd>‚Üë</kbd>, or <kbd>‚Üë</kbd>, to target the last, first, or first non-whitespace characters of every visible line in the editor.

Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> when completing the jump to select all text from the current cursor position to the destination.

If you mistype a character while searching, just press <kbd>Backspace</kbd> to restart from scratch.

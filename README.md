# AceJump

[AceJump](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7086) is a plugin for the [IntelliJ Platform](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/) that lets you jump to any symbol in the editor with just a few keystrokes. Pressing the keyboard shortcut for AceJump (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> by default) will activate a tooltip overlay. Type any visible string in the editor, followed by one of illustrated tags, to jump that location:

Press the AceJump shortcut a second time before completing a jump to activate *Target Mode*. Once *Target Mode* is activated, jumping to a tag will select the entire word at a jump target. You can also enter *Target Mode* directly by pressing the shortcut assigned to `AceTargetMode` (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> by default).

Press the AceJump shortcut for line mode (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> by default), to highlight the beginning, first non-whitespace characters, and end of every visible line in the editor). You can then jump by completing the tag.

Press the AceJump shortcut, followed by <kbd>‚Üí</kbd>, <kbd>‚Üê</kbd>, <kbd>‚Üë</kbd>, or <kbd>‚Üë</kbd>, to tag the last, first, or first non-whitespace characters, of every visible line in the editor.

Press <kbd>Shift</kbd> when completing the jump to select all text from the current cursor position to the destination.

## Installing

AceJump can be installed by the unzipping the contents of `AceJump.zip` into:

- `$HOME/.IdeaIC`&lt;Major Version&gt;`/config/plugins/` if you are using IntelliJ IDEA Community, or
- `$HOME/.IntellijIdea`&lt;Major Version&gt;`/config/plugins/` if you are using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

You can also install AceJump directly from the IDE, via **File \| Settings \| Plugins \| Browse Repositories... \| üîç "AceJump"**.

## Configuring

You can change the default keyboard shortcut by visiting **File \| Settings \| Keymap \| üîç "AceJump" \| AceJump \|** <kbd>Enter‚èé</kbd>.

If you are using [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164), paste the following command into your terminal to activate AceJump with a single keystroke. 

```
echo - e "map f :action AceAction<CR>\nmap F :action AceTargetAction<CR>\nmap g :action AceLineAction<CR>" >> ~/.ideavimrc
```

The previous command will add the following lines to your `~/.ideavimrc` file (the keys <kbd>f</kbd>, <kbd>F</kbd> and <kbd>g</kbd> are user-configurable):

```
map f :action AceAction<CR>
map F :action AceTargetAction<CR>
map g :action AceLineAction<CR>
```

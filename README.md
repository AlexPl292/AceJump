# AceJump

[AceJump](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7086) is a plugin for the [IntelliJ Platform](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/) that lets you jump to any symbol in the editor with just a few keystrokes.

Hitting the keyboard shortcut for AceJump (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> by default) will activate a tooltip overlay. Type any visible string in the editor, followed by one of illustrated tags, to jump that location. If you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>;</kbd> a second time before completing the jump, AceJump will select the whole word instead. If you press <kbd>Shift</kbd> when completing the jump, AceJump will select all text from the current cursor position to the destination. It's that simple.

## Installing

AceJump can be installed by the unzipping the contents of `AceJump.zip` into:

- `$HOME/.IdeaIC`&lt;Major Version&gt;`/config/plugins/` if you are using IntelliJ IDEA Community, or
- `$HOME/.IntellijIdea`&lt;Major Version&gt;`/config/plugins/` if you are using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate

You can also install AceJump directly from the IDE, via **File \| Settings \| Plugins \| Browse Repositories... \| üîç "AceJump"**.

## Configuring

You can change the default keyboard shortcut, by visiting **File \| Settings \| Keymap \| üîç "AceJump" \| AceJump \|** <kbd>Enter‚èé</kbd>.

If you are using [IdeaVim](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164), you may wish to remap a single key to activate AceJump. For example, adding the following line to `Àú/.ideavimrc` will activate AceJump whenever the <kbd>F</kbd> key is pressed:

```
map f :action AceJumpAction<CR>
```

## Building

In order to build AceJump from the source, clone this repository and run `./gradlew buildPlugin`.

## History

- 3.0.1 Fixes target-mode issues affecting users with non-default shortcuts and adds support for Home/End.

>#### 3.0.0 Major rewrite of AceJump. Introducing:
>
>* Realtime search: Just type the word where you want to jump and AceJump will 
do the rest.
>* Smart tag placement: Tags now occupy nearby whitespace if available, rather 
than block text.
>* Keyboard-aware tagging: Tries to minimize finger travel distance on QWERTY 
keyboards.
>* Colorful highlighting: AceJump will now highlight the editor text, 
as you type.
